# About the dataset
Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset)

# Introduction 
This project tends to estimate % of the body fat in a human's body based on parameters such as weight, Hip size, chest size and many more.

# Project Flow

1) Load the data into dataframe.

2) Perform data preprocessing like handling missing values, feature creation, etc.

3) Perform exploratory data analysis and get valuable insights from the data.

4) Perform feature selection and select best model which fits the data.

5) After feature selection and EDA, perform hyper-parameter tuning to select the best model.

5) Pickle and Unpickle the model while integrating it with UI which is made using Flask.

6) Deploy the model on microsoft azure cloud platform.
